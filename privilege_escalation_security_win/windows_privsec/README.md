# Windows Privilege Escalation

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

-What Windows privilege escalation is and why it is important in cybersecurity ?

-How token manipulation (e.g., SeImpersonatePrivilege) can be exploited for privilege escalation?

-What DLL hijacking is and how it can lead to elevated privileges?

-How unquoted service paths create opportunities for privilege escalation.?

-How misconfigured service permissions can allow attackers to escalate privileges?

-What vulnerabilities in scheduled tasks and at jobs can be exploited for privilege escalation?

-How weak registry permissions can lead to privilege escalation?

-Whatâ€™s the role of insecure file permissions in privilege escalation attacks.?

-How attackers can bypass UAC (User Account Control)?

-How the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) can be abused by attackers to gain higher privileges?

-The key tools used in Windows privilege escalation (e.g., JuicyPotato, Mimikatz)?

-What are common mitigation strategies to prevent privilege escalation in Windows environments?
