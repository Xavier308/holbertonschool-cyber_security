# Advanced Web Attack Techniques

This project focuses on exploiting and understanding various web application vulnerabilities.

## Overview

The repository contains solutions for multiple web security challenges including:
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) exploitation
- Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
- PHP Deserialization vulnerabilities
- Session manipulation techniques

## Requirements

- Testing environment: Kali Linux
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files should end with a new line

## Challenges

Each task simulates real-world attack scenarios:
1. XSS in a photo gallery application
2. SSTI in a notes application with blacklist bypass
3. Path traversal and credential theft
4. Session hijacking on an e-learning platform
5. PHP deserialization exploitation in an upload feature

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the impact of web vulnerabilities
- Identify and exploit different types of XSS
- Implement prevention techniques
- Recognize secure coding practices
- Integrate security checks into development lifecycle
