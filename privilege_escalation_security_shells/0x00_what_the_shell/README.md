# What Is the Shell?

## Learning Objectives
- Explain what a shell is and its role in Linux (Bash) and Windows (PowerShell)  
- Describe basic and advanced Bash features  
- Write and execute one-line shell scripts  
- Compare CMD vs. PowerShell and cross-platform PowerShell usage  
- Illustrate the shell’s importance in automation and system administration  

## Rules
- **Editors:** vi, vim or emacs only  
- **Environment:** scripts tested on Kali Linux  
- **Format:** each script must be exactly one line (`wc -l file` → 1) and end with a newline  
- **Task 0 blacklist:** bash, sh, zsh, grep, pipes (`|`), control structures, etc.  
- **Task 1 blacklist:** same as Task 0 + no spaces, no `-`, `*`, `?`, loops/conditionals, etc.  

## Files
- `1-flag.txt` – bypass moderate blacklist  
- `2-flag.txt` – bypass strict blacklist
