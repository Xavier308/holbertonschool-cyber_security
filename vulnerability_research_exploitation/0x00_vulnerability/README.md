# Vulnerability Research and Exploitation

This project explores the process of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in a Windows system through a series of structured tasks.

## Project Overview

This practical exercise focuses on conducting a complete security assessment of a vulnerable Windows machine, using industry-standard tools and techniques to discover, analyze, exploit, and extract sensitive information.

## Tasks

### 0. Discovery with Nmap
* Use Nmap to identify the target machine's IP address, open ports, services, and operating system.
* Script: `0-nmap.sh` - A two-line Bash script that performs the scan.
* Results documented in `0-nmap.md`.

### 1. Vulnerability Assessment with Nessus
* Perform a comprehensive vulnerability scan using Nessus.
* Document identified vulnerabilities, with particular focus on MS17-010 (EternalBlue).
* Results exported to `nessus_rapport.csv`.

### 2. CVE Research Using NVD
* Research MS17-010 vulnerability (CVE-2017-0144) using the National Vulnerability Database.
* Document the CVE ID, description, CVSS score, potential impacts, and available mitigations.
* Findings recorded in `2-ms_17_010.md`.

### 3. Exploitation with Metasploit
* Execute the exploit using Metasploit Framework to establish a Meterpreter session.
* Navigate the compromised system to locate and capture the flag.
* Flag saved in `flag.txt`.

### 4. Post-Exploitation and Password Extraction
* Extract password hashes for Administrator and Holderton_simpleuser accounts.
* Document the extraction process and save hashes in `4-password_extraction.txt`.

### 5. Password Cracking
* Crack the extracted password hashes using John the Ripper and the rockyou.txt wordlist.
* Document the cracking process and results in `5-crack.txt`.

## Requirements
* Kali Linux VM for executing all tasks
* Target Windows VM (vulnerable machine)
* Tools: Nmap, Nessus, Metasploit Framework, John the Ripper, rockyou wordlist
