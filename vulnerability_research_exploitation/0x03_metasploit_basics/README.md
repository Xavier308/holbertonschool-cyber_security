# Metasploit Basics Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the setup and usage of Metasploit Framework for vulnerability exploitation, focusing on the EternalBlue (MS17-010) vulnerability in Windows 7 systems.

## Project Structure
- `metasploit_workflow.sh`: Script for Metasploit setup and exploitation
- `notes.csv`: Documentation of findings during penetration testing
- `payload.elf`: Sample payload generated using msfvenom
- `loot.csv`: Collected data from exploited systems

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Metasploit Setup with PostgreSQL
- PostgreSQL installation and configuration
- Database user and database creation
- Metasploit initialization with database connection

### 2. EternalBlue Exploitation
- Target identification via Nmap (Windows 7 SP1)
- MS17-010 vulnerability confirmation
- Successful exploitation using the EternalBlue module
- Meterpreter session established on target (192.168.10.128)

### 3. Payload Creation
- Generated Linux ELF payload using msfvenom
- Configured for reverse TCP connection
- Set up with attacker machine ip as listener

### 4. Auxiliary Module Exploration
- SMB vulnerability scanning
- Port scanning of target system
- Service version enumeration

### 5. Documentation
- Created notes within Metasploit about exploitation
- Exported findings to CSV format
- Collected system information and stored as loot

## Execution
The project successfully demonstrated the vulnerability of Windows 7 systems to the MS17-010 exploit, with proper documentation of the penetration testing process.

## Security Notice
All testing was performed in an isolated virtual environment for educational purposes only.
