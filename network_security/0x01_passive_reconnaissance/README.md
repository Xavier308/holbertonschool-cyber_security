# Passive Reconnaissance

This project focuses on learning and implementing various passive reconnaissance techniques in cybersecurity. It covers essential tools and concepts used to gather information about target systems without direct interaction.

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding DNS servers and records (A, MX, TXT)
- Working with reconnaissance tools like `whois`, `dig`, and `nslookup`
- Using Subfinder for subdomain enumeration
- Learning about Shodan.io and DNS Dumpster
- Understanding the difference between active and passive reconnaissance

## Project Tasks

1. WHOIS Information Extraction
2. DNS A Record Lookup
3. DNS MX Record Lookup
4. DNS TXT Record Lookup
5. Complete DNS Records with dig
6. Subdomain Enumeration with Subfinder
7. Shodan Domain Research
8. CTF Challenges (DNS Records)
