# Nmap Live Host Discovery

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive exploration of network host discovery techniques using Nmap, focusing on various scanning methodologies for identifying live hosts across different network environments.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will understand:
- Nmap fundamentals
- Network host discovery techniques
- Subnetwork scanning
- Different types of network probing methods

## Key Scanning Techniques

### 1. ARP Scan
- Local network host discovery
- MAC address identification
- Non-routable network scanning

### 2. ICMP Scanning Methods
- ICMP Echo Scan
- ICMP Timestamp Scan
- ICMP Address Mask Scan

### 3. TCP Scanning Techniques
- TCP SYN Ping Scan
- TCP ACK Ping Scan
- Privileged and unprivileged scanning modes

### 4. UDP Scanning
- UDP Ping Scan
- Service-specific port probing

## Practical Skills
- Network reconnaissance
- Host enumeration
- Live host identification
- Network topology mapping

## Tools and Techniques
- Nmap
- Subnetwork scanning
- Host discovery flags
- Privilege-based scanning

## Requirements
- Kali Linux environment
- Root or sudo privileges
- Systematic network exploration approach

## Scanning Considerations
- Different scan types yield varied results
- Network configuration impacts scan effectiveness
- Privileged vs. unprivileged scanning differences


**Note**: Network security requires responsible and ethical practice.
