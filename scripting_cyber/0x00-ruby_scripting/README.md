# Ruby Scripting for Cybersecurity

This project focuses on developing fundamental Ruby programming skills specifically for cybersecurity applications. The tasks cover a wide range of topics from basic Ruby syntax to more advanced security-related implementations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- Why Ruby is valuable in cybersecurity (Metasploit Framework, automation, custom exploits)
- How to implement basic Ruby programming concepts (functions, classes, file I/O)
- How to develop security-specific scripts (password crackers, HTTP requests, ciphers)
- How to create command-line tools for security testing

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All scripts will be tested on Kali Linux
- All files should end with a new line
- First line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env ruby`
- A README.md file at the root of the project is mandatory
- No backticks, &&, || or ; allowed
- Code should use the Betty style
- All files must be executable
- Use `$1` without quotes in scripts

## Tasks

0. **Hello World with Function** - Create a function that prints a greeting message
1. **Hello World with Class** - Print a greeting using a class structure
2. **Prime Number Checker** - Write a function to check if a number is prime
3. **Reading from a File** - Read content from a JSON file and count user IDs
4. **Writing to a File** - Merge JSON objects from one file into another
5. **Caesar Cipher** - Implement encryption and decryption using the Caesar cipher
6. **Simple HTTP Request** - Perform an HTTP GET request and format the response
7. **Command-Line Arguments** - Create a script that handles command-line arguments
8. **HTTP POST Request** - Make an HTTP POST request with parameters
9. **Downloading a File** - Download a file from a URL and save it locally
10. **Password Cracker** - Perform a dictionary attack on a hashed password
11. **Creating a Basic CLI Application** - Build a command-line interface using optparse

## Resources

The project includes extensive resources on:
- Ruby basics (documentation, courses)
- Specialized topics (HTTP requests, file operations, network tools)
- Security-specific implementations (vulnerability scanning, penetration testing)
- Advanced topics (web scraping, exception handling, threading)
